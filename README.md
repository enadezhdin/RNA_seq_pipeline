# RNA_seq_pipeline
This is working directory for the current version of the RNA Seq analysis pipeline. The pipeline is built based on Illumina MYSeq 500 fastq reads analysis. Salmon software used for the reads pseudomapping, and DESeq2 for differential gene expression modelling and analysis.
Using Keras with Tensorflow backend a neural network was designed, and trained to classify RNA-seq datasets.
